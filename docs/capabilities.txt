DGM Capabilities
----------------

 * Libraries for implementing the Discontinuous-Galerkin method (DGM).
   - Physics independent
   - C++, Object-oriented design
   - 32 and 64-bit builds

 * Built on the DTK Library interface
   - Reuse of software with other packages, e.g. Finite-Difference method (FDM).

 * Python interface via Cython

 * Other Third-Party Libraries (TPLs)
   - Atlas
   - BLAS
   - Boost
   - Dakota
   - Doxygen

   - LAPACK
   - OpenMPI
   - PEOpt
   - Trilinos

 * Serial and Parallel builds
   - Asynchronous MPI communication
   - Parallel I/O (MPI-IO)
   - Scales to 100,000 cores
   - Load balancing with internal and Zoltan decompositon

 * I/O
   - Parallel output
   - FieldSlice
   - On-the-fly runtime modification

 * Utilitizes unstructured meshes
   - Exodus format (e.g., from Cubit)
   - Gmesh
   - DGM meshing utility, dgm_mesh.exe

 * Refinement capability
   - Polynomial-order refinement (p-refinement) for both solution and media.
   - Cell refinement (h-refinement) via hanging-nodes; tris, quads, hexes.

 * Various element types (not all combinations)
   - Triangles, quadrilaterals, tetrahedrals, and hexahedrals
   - Modal, nodal, spectral, continuous
   - Affine elements for computational savings
