Descriptions of DGM_VERBOSE levels
==================================
0 = DGM is basically quiet -- most output is application
1 = Minimal DGM verbosity -- suitable for production use
2 = More information during construction, no verbosity during execution
3 = Very noisy construction and destruction, modest verbosity during execution
4 = Noisy during execution
5 = May actually dump out data, so watch out
