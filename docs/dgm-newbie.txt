Information on Starting on DGM
-------------------------------------------

1) DGM code

   Current Philosophy
   ------------------

   Our decision at this point is to keep the DGM repository distinct
   (for several reasons, not the least of which there are several
   projects that use DGM).  So, you will need to do a CVS update
   in your working directory.


   Checkout and Build (merger of 2 emails from Scott Collis)
   ---------------------------------------------------------

   If you would like to try out the DGM code, I have setup CVS access for you
   to "DGM" otherwise known as Chamisa on software.sandia.gov and/or
   test.sandia.gov and/or odin.sandia.gov (our cluster).
   
   To check out the current, optimization, enable version, use the following:
   
     cvs -d :ext:<username>@software.sandia.gov:/home/sscoll/cvsroot co \
     -r rel-1-1-control dgm
   
   Here are some useful commands:

     cd dgm
     cvs update -dP

   Please let me know if you would like to try this and I will have accounts
   made for you on software, test, and odin (and have you added to the "dgm"
   unix group).
   
   To build DGM you need to have a number of 3rd-party libraries including:
   
   Required:
      atlas
      boost
      fftw
      gsl
      itl
   Optional:
      mpich
      trilinos
   
   DGM expects that the required and optional libraries are available in a
   directory called ~/local (these can be sym-links or actual installs).  To
   make things easy, there is a tarball called local-linux.tgz in my home
   directory on software.sandia.gov that you can copy that should work on
   Linux systems (including both software and test).  If you are interested in
   running on Mac OS, Cygwin, or the Sandia ICC's let me know and I can help
   you out.  (It's been a while since I used Cygwin so we might have to dust
   that one off a bit).
   
   Right now, I don't use autoconf/autotools but instead have platform
   specific makefile include files stored in the dgm/src directly (e.g.
   Linux.inc, Darwin.inc, etc).  Once you have checked out 'dgm' and make your
   ~/local directory (note that on software or test you could just do a
   symbolic link to sscoll/local) then to build a serial 'dgm' executable you
   would do:
   
   cd ~/dgm  # assuming that is where you checked out the DGM source tree
   mkdir GCC
   cd GCC
   ln -s ../src/Makefile .
   make -j8 all
   
   Where -j8 indicates a parallel build on 8 processors.  This will make
   dgm.exe (as well as a number of other useful executables).  To make an mpi
   parallel version, do:
   
   cd ~/dgm  # assuming that is where you checked out the dgm source tree
   mkdir GCCp
   cd GCCp
   ln -s ../src/Makefile .
   ln -s ~/local/mpich2 mpi  # or point to another MPI library install 
                             # directory if you wish
   make -j8 pall
   
   This will make pdgm.exe and pdgm_opt.exe.

   Useful environment settings: (csh shown)
     setenv DGMDIR /home/ccober/dgm
     set path = ($path $DGMDIR/GCC $DGMDIR/GCCp $DGMDIR/util)
     setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH "/home/sscoll/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"

   To run a serial test case of inviscid, compressible flow over a 2d cylinder
   do the following:
   
   cd ~/dgm/runs/cyl
   Serial:  ~/dgm/GCC/dgm.exe cyl
   Parallel:  mpiexec -n 8 ~/dgm/GCCp/dgm.exe cyl
   
   Note: on software or test this assumes that you used the mpich2 install in
   ~/local/mpich2 and that ~/local/mpich2/bin is in your path so that you get
   the correct mpiexec.  On both software and test you should get a nearly
   perfect 8x speedup when running on 8 procs :-)
   
   There are a bunch of other "test" in the ~/dgm/runs directory that you can
   try out.  I can easily show you how to setup new runs, build meshes with
   Cubit, use tecplot or paraview to visualize, etc.  I can also show you how 
   to build a Trilinos enabled version as well but that is a separate email.
