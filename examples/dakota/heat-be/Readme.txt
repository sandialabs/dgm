This is a steady, Robin optimal boundary control using Dakota with the 
file system interface. This version uses Backward Euler time integration.

Running this example should be as easy as typing "run" in this directory as
long as dakota, dprepro, and dgm_opt.exe are in your path.

Compare the output to the reference output stored in heat.log.
