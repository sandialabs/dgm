# DGM example case
#
# Author:  S. Scott Collis <sscoll@sandia.gov>
#
# This exampe case is intended to demonstrate the use of a Dirac delta
# function source on the RHS of the Advection-Diffusion equation.
#
# The mesh is 20 elements from x \in [0,1] with a default polynomial order
# of 5 which gives an expected convergence rate of 6th order accuracy. 
# 
# Note that this case does not work well with the 3-step Adams-Bashforth 
# time integrator, especially in the presence of diffusion. By default
# the diffusion coefficient but you may uncomment the vis line and include
# diffusion if you want.
#
# The default boundary conditions are homogeneous Dirichlet on the left
# and a non-reflecting outflow condition on the right
#
# The initial condition is zero although you can select different expressions
# in 1d.ic.
